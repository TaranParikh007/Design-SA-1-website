        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or are associated with the ethno-linguistically diverse India.
        Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India. India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and 
        other religions. They are collectively known as Indian religions. India is considered the birthplace of some of the world's major religions: Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism. Today, other religions such as Muslim and 
        Christianity have worked their way into the population as well, though Hinduism remains the most popular. Hindus celebrate Diwali, Holi and Makar Sakranti, Muslims observe Eid, Baisakhi (crop harvesting) is a Sikh festival, 
        Jains commemorate Mahavir Jayanti and Buddhists mark Buddha's birthday. Christmas and Good Friday are celebrated by Christians too. 
    </p>
    
        <p>
            Indian culture is one of the oldest and most diverse cultures in the world. Still, many Indians are stick to their culture. Indian's way of hospitality, greeting, ethics, belongingness, unity, adapting behaviour makes India unique in
            sustaining it's culture over than rest of the world. 
        </p>
    
    
        <p>
            Indian culture is complex in nature and with diversity in religion and their customs we live with unity. The two most important tenets of Indian culture are Human Values and Holism. Human values refer to moral, spiritual and ethical values while 
            Holism means oneness or unity.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The most respectful thing about indian culture is the Westerners may shake hands, however, greeting with 'namaste' (placing both hands together with a slight bow) is appreciated and shows respect for Indian customs. Men shake hands 
            with men when meeting or leaving. Men do not touch women when meeting or greeting.

        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            1) Rajasthan : Rajasthan 'Land of Kings' or 'Land of Kingdom' is India's largest state by area. The state located on northwest part of country and is a home of cultural diversity. Its features include the ruins of Indus Valley Civilization, Temples, Forts and Fortresses in almost every city
        </p>
           
            <p>
                Religion: Rajasthanis are predominantly Hindu, Muslims and Jains. However, regardless of their religious segments, Muslim, Hindu and Jain Rajasthanis mingle with each other socially. Most Rajasthani Hindus are vaishnavas, however, Durga and her avatars are equally worshiped throughout Rajasthan.
            </p>

    <p>
        Famous Art : Māru-Gurjara architecture, or "Solaṅkī style" is a distinctive style that began in Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat around the 11th century, and has been revived and taken to other parts of India and the world by both Hindus and Jains.
    </p>
   
    <p>

        Attire: Rajasthan’s rich culture is exhibited via its majestic forts, royal palaces, vibrant festivals, delicious food, performing arts, and even traditional costumes. The traditional outfit is colourful and elaborate, and is still proudly worn by Rajasthanis. Here’s an introduction to Rajasthan’s traditional dress.
        Women’s traditional dress : Traditional attire for Rajasthani women is ghagra, choli (also called kanchli or kurti) and odhni. The ghagra is a full-length, embroidered and pleated skirt, which comes in a variety of colours, prints and fabrics, such as silk, cotton, georgette and crêpe. Of all the various prints, the laharia, bandhej, tie ‘n dye, chundri and mothra are the most widely worn. To impart royal elegance, antique borders and Jaipuri gota-patti work are incorporated to the ghagra.
The traditional outfit for Rajasthani men is dhoti and angarkha, or pyjama-kurta. The dhoti is a long piece of cloth tied around the waist and wrapped around like a loin-cloth between the legs. It is paired with angarkha, a type of robe characterized by an inner panel that covers the chest. The angarkha is usually worn by the wealthy class. However, some tribal and pastoral communities have adopted it, reserving it for special occasions. The length and flare of this garment varies. The royal Rajput clan prefers wearing flared, ankle-length angarkha, while other communities and tribal groups wear knee-length or shorter versions. For everyday use, men wear angarkhi (or, puthia), which is short and tied with laces, not buttons.

    </p>
    <p>
Footwear for men and women:
Both men and women in Rajasthan wear jootis or mojaris. They are leather shoes made up of sheep, camel or goat skin, complete with intricate embroidery and embellishments. While traditional footwear is usually black or brown, nowadays much more fashionable multi-coloured slip-ons are also available.
    </p>

    <p>
        Architecture: Rajasthan's architecture is chiefly based on Rajput school of architecture which was an assortment of the Mughal and the Hindu structural plan. The astonishing forts, the beautifully engraved temples and the splendid Havelis of the Rajasthan state are essential parts of Rajasthan's architectural heritage.Māru-Gurjara architecture, or "Solaṅkī style" is a distinctive style that began in Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat around the 11th century, and has been revived and taken to other parts of India and the world by both Hindus and Jains. This represents the main contribution of the region to Hindu temple architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuisine:
    </p>
    <p>
        1) Dal baati churma: This is the state's classic signature dish. Baati is hard, unleavened bread cooked in the desert areas of Rajasthan. Baati is prized mainly for its long shelf life, plus it requires hardly any water for its preparation. It is always eaten with dal (lentil curry). 
</p>
<p>
    Gatte ki subzi:
Most of Rajasthani cusine came to fruition as a result of the arid conditions. For this dish you don’t need any fresh vegetables and that’s its speciality. This curry is made with gram flour dumplings (steamed and lightly fried) and tangy gravy made up of tomato, buttermilk and spices. It’s best enjoyed with rotis (Indian flat bread) and rice.
</p>
<p>
    Papad ki subzi:
The shortage of rain and water always made Rajasthanis think out of the box, and this dish was a lifesaver when they ran out of vegetables. In this popular curry, roasted papads (thin Indian flatbreads made from lentils) are broken roughly and added to the yogurt gravy made with gram flour, chilli powder, turmeric and chopped coriander leaves. The result is a mouth watering curry usually served with steamed rice.
</p>
<p>
    Onion kachori:

Pyaaz ki kachori originated in Jodhpur and is now eaten all over the state, mainly as a breakfast snack. They are flaky, deep-fried breads made from plain flour and stuffed with a spicy onion mixture with spices like fennel, cumin, turmeric and chilli powder. Usually, kachoris are served with coriander & mint and date & tamarind chutney.

        <h1>Facts</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
            
        <p>
1) Land of the 'Hindus'
          </p>
          <p>
The name "India" is derived from the River Indus, around which the Indus Valley civilization flourished over 5,000 years ago. The native worshippers referred to the river as Sindhu. Persian invaders changed it to Hindu. The name "Hindustan," often used to refer to India, combines Sindhu and Hindu and refers to the land of the Hindus. However, in the Hindi language, the country is called "Bharat." 
      </p>

      <p>
2) Diverse religions
</p>
<p>
India is the birthplace of four major religions, including Hinduism and Buddhism. While about 84% of the country identifies as Hindu, it is also the home to one of the largest Muslim populations in the world. Jews and Christians have also lived in India since 200 B.C. and 52 A.D. respectively. However, religious minorities are increasingly feeling insecure amid the rise of Hindu nationalism.
      </p>
      <p>
3) Woman as 'Devi'
</p>
<p>
Hindus have traditionally placed women on a high pedestal, even revering them as goddesses. But treatment of girls and women in today's India has been anything but respectful. The country is considered one of the most dangerous for women, with a woman raped every 20 minutes, according to government data. The practice of dowry and female infanticide are still widely prevalent.
      </p>
      <p>
4) Holy cow!
</p>
<p>
The cow is sacred for India's Hindus, who make up more than 80% of the nation's population, but they do not consider it to be God. In Hindu mythology, the animal is related to several deities, like Krishna, the cowherd god — or Shiva, who rides his bull, Nandi. It also makes economic sense for the poor to use various cow products — milk, curd, butter, ghee, urine, dung — rather than just meat.
      </p>
      <p>
5)Vegetarian nation?
</p>
<p>
However, it's a myth that India is a largely vegetarian country. While government surveys and various estimates suggest that more than a third of Indians do not eat meat, some experts believe that the "cultural and political pressures" cause many Indians to underreport meat consumption — particularly beef — and overreport vegetarian diets. The actual number of vegetarians is likely much lower.
      </p>
      <p>
6) Fasting as a way of life
</p>
<p>
The practice of fasting is an integral part of Hinduism. Fasting does not necessarily mean the body has to go without food; instead, it is sometimes sufficient to eliminate certain types of food and replace them with others, without restricting quantity. Mahatma Gandhi was a fervent supporter of fasting due to religious conviction. He saw it as a way to free oneself from bodily constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
7)Namaste: The greeting 
</p>
<p>
The most common daily greeting in India is "namaste." Simply place your hands together at the heart and bow a little. In Sanskrit "namaste" means "the divine in me bows to the divine in you," and it serves as both "hello" and "bye." It can be used at any time, with anyone. Another less common Hindu greeting is touching an elder's feet with both hands to show respect and seek their blessings.
      </p>
      <p>
8) The ABCs of India
      </p>
      <p>
        Astrology, Bollywood and Cricket: Experts believe that religion, Hindi movies and the game of cricket is the holy trinity that makes India's heart beat. The three topics attract the most internet traffic, with global tech and media giants exploiting them to penetrate the Indian masses.
      </p>
<p>
9) Wedding affairs
</p>
<p>
Unlike in the West, in India you don't choose to get married on any random day. Families reach out to priests and astrologers to choose an auspicious date. In Hindu families, the horoscopes of the bride and groom to be are also checked for compatibility. A traditional Hindu wedding tends to last over many hours. The event includes multiple ceremonies that occur before the main wedding ritual.
</p>

<p>
10) Symbols of a married woman
</p>
<p>
Bindi (ornamental dot on the forehead), bangles and sindoor (vermillion powder) are symbols worn by Hindu married women. They are also known to carry some physiological significance. For example, sindoor consists of turmeric-lime and the metal mercury. Due to its properties, mercury controls blood pressure and also activates sexual drive, one reason why widows are not allowed to apply sindoor.
